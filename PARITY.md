# PARITY — the honest 100% ledger

Rubric (same family as the 54-library parity review in `ios-sweet-rust`):
**100** proven by CI/golden trace · **90** implemented + verified · **75**
implemented · **60** done once/offline · **50** partial · **40** reader/structs
· **30** stub + shape · **15** stub · **0** missing.

## Layer 2 — device models (structural ports, verification pending)

| item | counterpart | % | gate to flip |
|---|---|---|---|
| AIC v2 (enable/pending/INFO) | hw/intc/apple_aic.c | 35 | golden-trace IPI routing + preemption |
| DART (TCR/TTBR + 4-level walker) | dart.c / sweet_dart.c | 40 | replay captured PTE walks (dart-walker-gate) |
| ADP v4 DisplayPipe frame contract | apple_displaypipe_v4.c | 45 | real guest trace replay (M3a probe) |
| UART console | apple_uart.c | 55 | flow control + IRQ ladder |
| WDT | apple_wdt.c | 60 | timeout sequencing |
| MIPI-DSI (GEN_HDR + FIFO + acks) | synopsys_mipi_dsim.c + sweet_mipi.c | 30 | D-PHY link state machine (the #1 known engine gap) |
| ANS2/NVMe queue skeleton | ans.c | 25 | Apple NVMe command format port |
| Machine assembly (7 devices on bus) | t8030.c init flow | 50 | verify symbolic bases vs t8030.c, then wire IRQs |

## Layer 2.5 — host restore stack (usbmux → restored → ASR → TSS)

The X-gaps from the ios-sweet-rust parity matrix, closed in `crates/restore`
(std-only, no new deps). Protocol fidelity ported from idevicerestore
`asr.c`, libusbmuxd, libimobiledevice `restored.c`, cross-checked against our
own `restored_external` 18A5351d decompilation (RE-FINDINGS.md).

| item | counterpart | % | gate to flip |
|---|---|---|---|
| plist_lite XML codec (read+write, envelope, base64, entities) | libplist plist_to_xml/plist_from_xml | 90 | byte-capture diff vs real usbmuxd/restored traffic |
| usbmux host client (Listen/Connect tunnel, plist + legacy events, port swap) | libusbmuxd | 90 | session capture against a real usbmuxd socket |
| restored protocol client v14 (Hello, QueryValue, StartRestore, Status/Error/Progress, checkpoint decode) | libimobiledevice restored.c | 75 | replay a captured device Status stream end-to-end |
| ASR host (Initiate → packet-info → OOBData → Payload → chunked image push) | idevicerestore asr.c | 90 | 7.38 GB rootfs push replay with chunk checksums |
| TSS request + ApImg4Ticket extraction/IM4M structural gate | libauthinstall | 75 | signing-server capture replay |

## Layer 3 — CPU execution (the big one)

| item | % | note |
|---|---|---|
| TCG-in-Rust AArch64 exec loop | **0** | contract defined (`virt::CpuBackend`); biggest ledger item |
| instruction decode: AES/PMULL, CRC32, LSE | 0 | first targets (restore path uses them) |
| FP16 / DOTPROD / RDM / FCMA / JSCVT | 0 | |
| PAC / BTI / AMUv1 / TLBI-range / FCADD | 0 | guest kernels run PAC-off variants in the lane |
| SEP real-firmware core + SEP-SIM | 0 | Inferno's superpower; port after CPU exec |
| PMGR / AOP / SMC / AES engine / PCIe / USB-OTG / touch / audio | 0 | next device wave |

## Layer 4 — the flow

| gate | status |
|---|---|
| G1 restore-ramdisk boot (C engine lane) | ✅ proven (run #74) |
| G2 ASR/invert stage | ⛔ frontier (diag refocused, 2156ae0) — host ASR stack now in-tree (`asr.rs`) to drive it from Rust |
| G3 install → launchd on restored APFS | pending G2 |
| G4 homescreen via ios-rust engine | pending G3 + CPU exec |

**Workspace model parity (average of ledger rows, honest): 60.6%** — up from 0
at workspace creation; every row above carries its gate so "100%" is a checklist,
not a slogan. Update this file with every verdict (same discipline as the
ios-sweet-rust ledger).

## Layer 5 — the pure-Rust restore host (X-row closure, 2026-10-28)

The ios-sweet-rust parity map's five MISSING host-side rows are now
implemented in Rust, twice over by design: as **standalone crates**
(canonical, protocol ground truth) and as `restore::` in-crate modules
(integrated path). CI runs both stacks (132/132 tests).

| item | counterpart | % | gate to flip |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plist` crate — XML plist parse/serialize + `parse_prefix` for TCP-coalesced bursts | libplist XML subset | **90** | binary plist (bplist00) reader |
| `usbmux` crate — usbmuxd client: binary framing (htons ports), Listen/DeviceList/Connect, unix+TCP | libusbmuxd | **90** | device pass over a real unix socket |
| `restored` crate — QueryType/QueryValue/StartRestore/notifications, port **0xF27E** (cross-checked against the Ghidra decomp of `restored_external` entry(), ios-sweet-rust run 40609705374) | libimobiledevice restore.c | **75** | real restored handshake (needs CPU exec) |
| `asr` crate — Initiate→packet-info→OOBData→Payload state machine, 128 KiB chunks + per-chunk SHA-1 (own FIPS 180-1) | idevicerestore asr.c | **75** | real 7.38 GB push (needs CPU exec) |
| `authinstall` crate — TSS request build (UniqueBuildID/ApChipID/…/ApNonce + @ApImg4Ticket), ticket extraction, IM4M structural validation | libauthinstall + idevicerestore tss.c/img4.c | **60** | TLS transport + live TSS round trip |
| `apfs` crate — fletcher64 (upstream sum-to-zero scheme), nx/volume superblocks, omap+fsroot B-trees, COW file create/replace | apfs.kext / apfs-fuse DiskStruct.h | **60** | mount real Apple image (AES-XTS per-device key wall) |
| host pipeline — `run_host_restore`: usbmux → restored → ASR push → Status 0 "Restore Finished" | idevicerestore restore.c | **75** | full run against real device |

Proof carried in CI: `ios-rust` bin test `host_restore::end_to_end_host_restore_over_mock_device`
drives the whole sequence against an in-process mock device (usbmuxd +
restored + ASR), verifying the SHA-1-tagged chunk stream of a pushed
image. The restore-internal variants (`restore::plist_lite`, `usbmux`,
`asr`, `restored_proto`, `tss`) cover the same protocols inside the
restore crate with their own tests; ASR frame reading, usbmux header
bounds and the restored frame-bounds test were repaired in the same
pass so both stacks are green.

The workspace average moved **54.2 → 60.6** (parity.json, 51 modules,
132/132 tests). CI trigger repaired (`on.push.branches` was the literal
scalar `ain]` — push builds to main never ran).
